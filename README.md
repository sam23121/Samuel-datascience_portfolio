# [Project 1: smart-anti-theft-system](https://github.com/sam23121/smart-anti-theft-system)
a smart anti theft system by using computer vision that can be used for one door way room or small office
this system uses a microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to sense if there is some one or object outthere
if there is it sends a signal to the camera which captures what it is in front of it and if there is a person it extracts
its face converts to and 128 column vector and  compares it with the database (for example the owners relative) if it is not
known it will send a message to the owner and captured photo of the robber through email to the owner

# [Project 2: crop-recomendation](https://github.com/sam23121/crop-recomendation)
a classification problem that is able to predict which crop is good for which type of soil
it recieves 4 different kind of data from the microcontroller sensors which are  temprature, humidity, ph value, mosture process it and
then sends it to the python script and trains it based 6 diffrent machine learning algortihms, finally it recommends the crop with the highest count

# [Project 3: Summarization](https://github.com/sam23121/summarization)
a natural languguage problem that recieves long story and output a summary of the story

# [Project 4: sentiment_analysis](https://github.com/sam23121/crop-recomendation)
sentiment analysis done on amazon customer that did
-data analysis and visualization
-data cleaning
-model training and prediction with logistic regression
-handling data imbalancing
-doing cross validation by using gridsearch and then doing predictions
-automating the model
